Transcript counts from all samples were quantified with Salmon v.0.8.2 and converted to gene-level counts with tximport. The gene-level counts from all studies were then normalized together using TMM with edgeR. Log2 transformed TMM-normalized counts per million: log2 (TMM-CPM + 1) expression values were used for the analysis.
